# **Low Light Object Detection**

## **Project Results and Overview**
This project focuses on improving object detection performance under low-light conditions. The primary objectives of this project were:
- To simulate realistic low-light environments and evaluate object detection algorithms.
- To enhance detection accuracy using data augmentation and model optimization techniques.

### **Key Results**
- Improved detection accuracy by **X%** in low-light conditions.
- Achieved real-time processing speed of **Y FPS** on NVIDIA A6000 GPU.
- Memory usage optimized to **Z MB** per image.

The motivation for this project stems from the increasing demand for robust computer vision systems that can operate reliably in challenging environments, such as nighttime surveillance and autonomous driving.
